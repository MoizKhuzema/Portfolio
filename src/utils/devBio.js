    description: `Hello! I'm Moiz, a machine learning engineer currently chilling on the corner of logic and creativity. I'm based in Pakistan and enjoy transforming complex data into captivating tech solutions. I specialize in all areas of statistical analysis, data manipulation, machine learning, computer vision and NLP. My programming journey is driven by a simple philosophy: "To blend innovation with utility, one line of code at a time."
    
    When I'm not coding, you can find me: reading poetry, showing love to my plants, drawing cartoons, watching The Big Bang Theory, or plotting to take over the world with an army of robots.
